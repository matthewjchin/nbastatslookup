<h1>NBA Player Stats Lookup</h1>

<p>
Find statistics of an NBA player for fantasy basketball use,
sports betting, or to just browse around and be a numbers guru. 

More features will be added over time. 

The web app is being deployed on Heroku, with plans to integrate a 
Postgres database via queries in SQL. It will pull data from the 
[nba_api](https://github.com/swar/nba_api) Python library as well as 
from the [NBA Advanced Stats site](https://www.nba.com/stats).
