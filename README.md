<h1>NBA Player Stats Lookup</h1>

<p>
Find statistics of an NBA player for fantasy basketball use,
sports betting, or to just browse around and be a numbers guru. 

More features will be added over time. 

The web app is being deployed on Heroku, with plans to integrate a 
Postgres database via queries in SQL. It will pull data from the 
[nba_api](https://github.com/swar/nba_api) Python library as well as 
from the [NBA Advanced Stats site](https://www.nba.com/stats).

<h2>7/4/23 UPDATE</h2>
<br>
The website URL is no longer functioning. Current testing and revisions are being done to the page.
Additionally, the overall concept of the project is being changed as well as the server used to host the site is still being decided.

You can still look through the code to see how the library was being used.
